Some Basic Python Problems

### Q1 
Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.
word list: (["PHP", "python", "zekelabs"])

### Q2
Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence
* word: 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'

### Q3
Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member
* list 1: [1,2,3,4,5] and list 2 : [5,6,7,8,9]))
* List -1([1,2,3,4,5], and List 2: [6,7,8,9]))

### Q4
(a) Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list
number: [1, 2, -8, -2, 0]
(b) Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list.
number: [1, 2, -8, -2, 0]

### Q5
(a) Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x)
* Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
* Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
(b) Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys
* d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
* d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
Sample output: Counter({'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300})

### Q6
(a)Write a Python program to add an item (i.e.any number) in a tuple
* tuplex = (4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 1)
(b) Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.
* tup = ('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's')
(c)Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple
* tuplex = 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7
(d) Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a dictionary.
* tuplex = ((2, "w"),(3, "r"))

### Q7
Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
* Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
* Expected Output :
  * Number of even numbers : 5
  * Number of odd numbers : 4
  
### Q8
(a) Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
* 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
* Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
* Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
(b) Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.

### Q9
(a) Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.
(b) Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list
(c) Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list
